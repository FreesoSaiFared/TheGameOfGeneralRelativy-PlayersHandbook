# The Game of General Relativity  
### *A Player’s Handbook*

> *“This is not a theory to be memorized.  
It is a system to be played.”*

## FORMAT & INTENT

This handbook is structured after the **AD&D 2nd Edition Monstrous Compendium**:  
a modular, binder-based reference system designed for **play**, not passive reading.

Each section functions like an entry:
- Self-contained
- Reorderable
- Printable
- Explicit about rules, constraints, and edge cases

General Relativity is treated as a *game system*, not a sacred text.

## SYSTEM SUMMARY

**Type:** Physical / Conceptual Game  
**Board:** Spacetime  
**Players:** Observers (Frames)  
**Referee:** Global Consistency  
**Hidden Mechanics:** Synchronization, Rotation, Curvature, Torsion  
**Failure Mode:** Coordinate Illusions

---

## CORE RULES (ABRIDGED)

**Frames**  
Frames are *player viewpoints*, not privileged realities.  
Choosing a frame is choosing a move.

**Synchronization**  
Time coordination is not automatic.  
If you don’t enforce it, the game punishes you (GPS, Sagnac).

**Local vs Global**  
Local freedom exists—but only if global consistency is maintained.  
Ignore this and contradictions emerge.

**Mathematics**  
Equations are **scorekeeping tools**, not the game itself.

## KNOWN EFFECTS (ENCOUNTERS)

- Relativity of Simultaneity  
- Sagnac Effect  
- Clock Desynchronization  
- Rotating Frames  
- GPS Corrections  
- Coordinate Artifacts mistaken for “physical effects”

---

## WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS

- Rule sheets  
- Playable thought experiments  
- Visual metaphors  
- Printable reference pages  
- Diagrams and referee notes  
- Future “entries” added incrementally

No expansions required. No lore bloat. No mysticism.

---

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Inspired by:
- AD&D 2e Monstrous Compendium (binder format)
- Pre-expansion modularity
- Systems thinking
- Physics without pedagogy theater

Everything is explicit. Nothing is assumed.

## INVITATION TO PLAY

If you have ever felt you were **punished for asking the wrong question** in relativity,  
this handbook is for you.

Stop memorizing moves.  
Start playing the game.
